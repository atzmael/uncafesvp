To start the dev server, use :

```
npm start
```

---

Use `dist/assets/` folder for 3D models, textures/maps, and other static ressources.

Search for '`TODO:`' in the repo to find pending/optimizable features.

---

To build, use :

```
npm run build
```

then the `dist` folder should be usable for deployment.
